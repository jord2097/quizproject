JavaScript Quiz Project

- A dynamic JavaScript personality quiz
- Could be repurposed by a non-coder by replacing the contents of questions.js (questions, answers and result categories)
- The number of questions or result types could be changed as the quiz code reads them.
- Single-page HTML design with DOM manipulation to show the desired element. Could be embedded into an existing website.
